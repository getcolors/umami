"""The deployment's machine keypair, per the workspace SSH Keypair Standard.

The behaviour itself is ONCE's (``package_once_blue.ssh``): keygen mode when
desired state carries no ``<provider>-ssh-keys`` for the selected compute
provider, an ed25519 key named after the profile in ``~/.ssh``, the create
matrix, the provider REST preflight (DigitalOcean, with its own token), and a
cleanup that runs only after a successful destroy. Reusing it
rather than reimplementing means one standard has one implementation, and a
fix upstream reaches this package when the pin moves.

What is added here is a build-time placeholder. ONCE derives the key paths from
``$HOME`` and does not commit rendered output; umami does commit goldens, so
on ``build`` the rendered paths must not name the operator's home directory or
the goldens would differ per workstation. Real events use the real paths.
