"""The deployment's `~/.ssh/config` block, per the workspace SSH Config Standard.

The block itself is written by the `ansible-local` stage, because that is the
one place the address is known and because `blockinfile` already handles the
idempotent replace. What lives here is everything that must happen before the
stage renders: the alias, the identity file, and the refusal to adopt a stanza
this package did not write.

Unlike the keypair, this play is the package's own copy rather than ONCE's
(standard §7). The file is shared with every other host the operator reaches,
so an unrelated change upstream must not be able to rewrite it at pin-bump
time.
