  "The deployment's machine keypair, per the workspace SSH Keypair Standard.

  The behaviour itself is ONCE's (`io.github.getcolors.once.ssh`): keygen mode
  when desired state carries no `<provider>-ssh-keys` for the selected compute
  provider, an ed25519 key named after the profile in `~/.ssh`, the create
  matrix, the provider REST preflight (DigitalOcean, with its own token), and
  a cleanup that runs only after a successful destroy. Reusing
  it rather than reimplementing means one standard has one implementation, and
  a fix upstream reaches this package when the pin moves.

  What is added here is a build-time placeholder. ONCE derives the key paths
  from `$HOME` and does not commit rendered output; umami does commit goldens,
  so on `:build` the rendered paths must not name the operator's home
  directory or the goldens would differ per workstation. Real events use the
  real paths."
